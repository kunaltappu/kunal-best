my first repository
I am doing the project on how to make the election process more secure ,reliable and transparent.
The first process of voting is applying for voter id .As everyone in India is possessing aadhar card on which date of birth is mentioned we can develop an application which generates e voter card after attaining age of 18 and send that message to the mobile number linked to that card and by this voting percentage will increase.
In this era when youths are living away from their constituency of voting the idea of online voting is is the best option to opt .the biometric verification along with otp on registered mobile number and voter id number can even help in malfunctioning in voting process and also reduces the time and resources which government uses on poll booths .Also it will increase employment and make the election process secure
And after voting we wait for result
